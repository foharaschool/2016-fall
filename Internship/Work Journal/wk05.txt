Notes: This week was spent mostly in specific training.  My manager wanted me to become the source of knowledge in building and launching salesforce communities.
On Wednesday, I pair coded with a senior developer.  He sat with me and walked me through writing a trigger in the salesforce apex language.
On Thursday, I pair coded with a senior intern.  I sat with him while we worked through the development of automated workflows, emails, and reports.  There was no coding involved.
