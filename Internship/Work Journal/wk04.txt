Internship Weekly Journal Status Report
Name: Fred O'Hara
Internship Company: Trident Contract Management
Dates: Apr. 11-14, 2016
Hours worked this week: 32
Total hours worked: 96
Notes: This week was spent mostly in training modules, though they are looking for work for me to do.  On Thursday I was handed a trouble-shoot task where I identified the problem, but am waiting for the sandbox to generate before I can test corrections.
